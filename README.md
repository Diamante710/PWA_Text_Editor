## <a name="Task"></a>Task

As a developer I am tasked with building a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria and feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also be able to function offline.
